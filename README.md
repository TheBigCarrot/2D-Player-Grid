# 2D-Player-Grid
A console-based grid on which a player moves.

I'm new to c++ so I'm just trying to make some projects from scratch like basic console-based games. 2D player grid is a basic grib on which a player can move on. I'm planning
on adding things like obstacles and some form of enemies to make it more game-like.
